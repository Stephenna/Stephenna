title: 'Airbnb Remake'
description: 'An Airbnb copycat project with a backend. I used sanity.io to store all of the property details, such as images, location, reviews, and host. I used Next.js to render the data to the front-end. The main page consists of all sample properties along with their locations marked onto the maps API. A slug is generated for each property. I have not been able to deploy the app as of yet due to webpack issues, but it does work in localhost.'
