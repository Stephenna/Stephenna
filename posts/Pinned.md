title: 'Pinned'
description: 'Pinned is an application that allows users to leave pins on a map. Once the user logs in or registers they can double click on the map. This double click will prompt a form to appear. In that form, the user can input a title, description, and 1-5 star rating. They can also view pins left behind by other users. I used MongoDB to verify login/registration, pins and the pins info such as title, description, rating, coordinates, username, and email.'
